===========

The YubiKey Key Storage Module (YK-KSM) provides a AES key storage
facility for use with a YubiKey validation server.

The YK-KSM is intended to be run on a locked-down server.

This separation allows third parties to keep tight control of the AES
keys for their YubiKeys, but at the same time allow external
validation servers (e.g., Yubico's) to validate OTPs from these
YubiKeys.

Releases are available from:

http://yubico.github.io/yubikey-ksm/releases.html

The YK-KSM was designed to work with the YubiKey validation server:
