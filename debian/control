Description: YubiKey KSM written in PHP
 The YubiKey Key Storage Module (YK-KSM) provides a AES key storage facility
 for use with a YubiKey validation server. The YK-KSM is intended to be run on
 a locked-down server. This separation allows third parties to keep tight
 control of the AES keys for their YubiKeys, but at the same time allow
 external validation servers (e.g., Yubico's) to validate OTPs from these
 YubiKeys.
 The YK-KSM was designed to work with yubikey-val-server-php.
